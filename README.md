# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Robot Navigation

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to our research project on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Robot Navigation. In this research, we focus on Single-Agent Q-learning applied to different environments and multi agents communications techniques. By the end of this , we'll analyze the results and explore how our agent navigates through the environments.
